## Syntax

### Component Creation

There are four common ways of creating React components:
1. createClass
2. ES classs
3. Function  - Preferred
4. Arrow function  - Preferred

### Technical Approach

React uses a modular approach in the utilisation of components.  
Components are injected into the DOM by use of Javascript, exemplary files within this project that show this at its most basic level include:  
- index.html  
- index.js  
- App.js  
- PageNotFound.js  

Studying the import/export logic between these files exhibits the core mechanism of React modularity.
